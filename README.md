SVG Web
=======

Overview
--------

SVG Web is a JavaScript library which provides [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) support on many browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. Using the library plus native SVG support you can instantly target ~95% of the existing installed web base.

Once dropped in you get partial support for SVG 1.1, SVG Animation (SMIL), Fonts, Video and Audio, DOM and style scripting through JavaScript, and more in a small library. Your SVG content can be embedded directly into normal HTML 5 or through the OBJECT tag. If native SVG support is already present in the browser then that is used, though you can override this and have the SVG Web toolkit handle things instead. No downloads or plugins are necessary other than Flash 10 which is used for the actual rendering, so it's very easy to use and incorporate into an existing web site.

This project is currently in Beta stage development. Many essential SVG features have been implemented but many other features have not been implemented such as filters (except blur, which is implemented) and CSS. Of the remaining features to be developed, some may never be developed, such as advanced filters, unless flash provides a reasonable way to do it.

It should also be noted that while Google has contributed to this project, Google is not providing support for this project. If you find a bug please file an [Issue](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/issues/list). Difficult problems generally take some time to get fixed but questions are usually answered quickly.
